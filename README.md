# TestingSystem
Full functional testing system in Console app


This program has 2 modes: User and Admin. To register an admin, during registration you must specify the word admin in the name field, and the password can be anything. Please note that there can be only one admin in the program. In the program, the Admin can add: categories, users, edit users, add questions, edit questions, etc.
And the user can pass all the tests in the selected categories that the admin added. And the program also has one possibility - you can interrupt the test at any time and continue it whenever you want.
All user data and the user himself are stored in the file, including questions and results.Passwords encrypted with simple XOR encryption
